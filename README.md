Hello ! First of all, I would like to thank you for taking the time to
check out my capstone project, after looking through my project I hope
you learned something new today!

    This is my final capstone project as part of my coursework in the 
Data Analytics Training Accelerator (DATA) offered by Galvanize & the 
NYC Tech Talent Pipeline. In this project, I performed an analysis of
the NYC TAXI DATASET from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/data
Using my skillset I performed analysis using Python, created visualizations
using Tableau, and put both of those together in a presentation not only
for my class, but also an audience comprised of people in the data world.
In this repo, you will find my final presentation slides, along wih my 
Jupyter Notebook and Tableau workbook. If you have any quesions feel free
to message me on GitHub or via email at danielwallace@ymail.com. Once again
thank you !
